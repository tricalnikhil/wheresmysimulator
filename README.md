wheresmysimulator
=================

**Where's My Simulator** runs a script to open the iOS Simulator Directory folder of your built app. 

This is a script to open the documents directory of a simulator in Xcode. The items in the list are sorted in the order of last updated device/iOS simulators.
- The MAC app runs directly.
- To run the script, you must have cocoaDialog installed and the app copied into the wheresmysimulator folder.

Download [cocoaDialog](http://mstratman.github.io/cocoadialog/)

Built using [Platypus](http://www.sveinbjorn.org/platypus)

Works for` Xcode 5.x` and `Xcode 6.x` only. Might work for lower versions, but I haven't tested this.
